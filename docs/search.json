Let’s assume that the exact same number of babies are born every day. In consequence, the number of children of a given age (in days) represents \\(n = 1 / d\\) percents of the total number of children in the 0-\\(t_3\\) day-old cohort.\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a vaccination with two doses at \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) and let’s call \\(c_1\\) the vaccine coverage of the first dose and \\(c_2\\) the vaccine coverage of the second dose, given the first dose. Let’s call \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) the vaccine efficiencies of the first and second doses respectively, with \\(e_1 \\leq e_2\\). The percentage of the cohort with one dose only thus reads:\n\\[\np_1 = [(t_2 - t_1) \\times c_1 + (t_3 - t_2) \\times c_1 \\times (1 - c_2)] \\times \\frac{1}{t_3}\n\\]\nAnd the percentage of the cohort with two doses reads:\n\\[\np_2 = (t_3 - t_2) \\times c_1 \\times c_2 \\times \\frac{1}{t_3}\n\\]\nThe cohort level of sero-protection then reads:\n\\[\ns = p_1 \\times e_1 + p_2 \\times e_2\n\\]\n\n\n\nSometimes the vaccine coverage of the second dose is expressed as \\(c_2'\\) with the total number of children expected to received the 2 doses of vaccine in the denominator instead of number of children having already received a first dose as done for \\(c_2\\), meaning:\n\\[\nc_2' = c_1 \\times c_2\n\\]\nwith \\(c_2' \\leq c_1\\). Then, the above equations have to be updated with the percentage of the cohort with one dose now reading:\n\\[\np_1' = [(t_2 - t_1) \\times c_1 + (t_3 - t_2) \\times (c_1 - c_2')] \\times \\frac{1}{t_3}\n\\]\nThe percentage of the cohort with two doses now reads:\n\\[\np_2' = (t_3 - t_2) \\times c_2' \\times \\frac{1}{t_3}\n\\]\nThe cohort level of sero-protection then reads:\n\\[\ns = p_1' \\times e_1 + p_2' \\times e_2\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis functions uses the above equations to compute the population level of sero-protection:\n\nprotection1 <- function(t1, t2, t3, c1, c2, e1, e2, conditional = TRUE) {\n  if (! conditional) {\n    if (c2 > c1) stop(\"c2 cannot be greater than c1.\")\n    c2 <- c2 / c1\n  }\n  n <- 1 / t3\n  one_dose <- ((t2 - t1) * c1 + (t3 - t2) * c1 * (1 - c2)) * n\n  two_doses <- (t3 - t2) * c1 * c2 * n\n  one_dose * e1 + two_doses * e2\n}\n\nLet’s see an example of this function use with the two expressions of the coverage of the second dose:\n\nprotection1(t1 = 9 * 30,  # timing of the first dose (in days)\n            t2 = 18 * 30, # timing of the second dose (in days)\n            t3 = 5 * 365, # duration of the cohort (in days)\n            c1 = .85,     # vaccine coverage first dose\n            c2 = .85,     # vaccine coverage second dose | first dose\n            e1 = .85,     # vaccine efficiency first dose\n            e2 = .95)     # vaccine efficiency second dose\n\n[1] 0.6664815\n\n\nand:\n\nprotection1(t1 = 9 * 30,  # timing of the first dose (in days)\n            t2 = 18 * 30, # timing of the second dose (in days)\n            t3 = 5 * 365, # duration of the cohort (in days)\n            c1 = .85,     # vaccine coverage first dose\n            c2 = .85,     # vaccine coverage second dose | first dose\n            e1 = .85,     # vaccine efficiency first dose\n            e2 = .95,     # vaccine efficiency second dose\n            conditional = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.6754589\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming the same vaccine coverage for the two doses, we can look at the relationship between vaccine coverage and sero-prevalence:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{t_3 - t_1}{t_3} e_1 \\times c + \\frac{t_3 - t_2}{t_3} (e_2 - e_1) \\times c^2\n\\]\nSome utilitary functions:\n\nabline2 <- function(...) abline(..., col = \"lightgrey\")\nlines2 <- function(...) lines(..., lwd = 3)\n\nplot_square1 <- function(xlab = \"vaccine coverage\", ylab = \"sero-prevalence\") {\n  opar <- par(pty = \"s\")\n  plot(0, 0, type = \"n\", xlim = 0:1, ylim = 0:1, asp = 1, xaxs = \"i\", yaxs = \"i\",\n       xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab)\n  par(opar)\n  abline2(v = seq(0, 1, .1))\n  abline2(h = seq(0, 1, .1))\n  box(bty = \"o\")\n}\n\nplot_layout <- function() {\n  plot_square1()\n  abline(0, 1)\n}\n\n\nprot1 <- function(t1 = 9 * 30,\n                  t2 = 18 * 30,\n                  t3 = 5 * 365,\n                  c,\n                  e1 = .85,\n                  e2 = .95) {\n  (t3 - t1) * e1 * c / t3 + (t3 - t2) * (e2 - e1) * c^2 / t3\n}\n\n# vaccine coverage values (x axis):\ncov_val <- seq(0, 1, le = 500)\n\n# layout of the plot:\nplot_layout()\n\n# sero-prevalences:\nlines2(cov_val, prot1(c = cov_val, e2 = .95), col = 4)\nlines2(cov_val, prot1(c = cov_val, e2 = .85), col = 3)\n\n\n\n\nWith the other formulation (second dose not conditional on first dose):\n\\[\ns = \\left[\\frac{t_2 - t_1}{t_3} e_1 + \\frac{t_3 - t_2}{t_3} e_2\\right] c\n\\]\n\nprot2 <- function(t1 = 9 * 30,\n                  t2 = 18 * 30,\n                  t3 = 5 * 365,\n                  c,\n                  e1 = .85,\n                  e2 = .95) {\n  ((t2 - t1) * e1 + (t3 - t2) * e2) * c / t3\n}\n\n# layout of the plot:\nplot_layout()\n\n# sero-prevalences:\nlines2(cov_val, prot2(c = cov_val, e2 = .95), col = 4)\nlines2(cov_val, prot2(c = cov_val, e2 = .85), col = 3)\n\n\n\n\nVery similar.\n\n\n\nHere we assume that the first dose is missing for a proportion \\(p\\) of the population but, also, that, for those missing the first dose, the timing of the second dose \\(t_2'\\) is earlier than \\(t_2\\).
