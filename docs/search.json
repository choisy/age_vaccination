    "text": "Let’s consider an age cohort from 0 to \\(t_3\\) day-old and let’s assume that contacts within this cohort are homogeneous. Let’s assume that the exact same number of babies are born every day. In consequence, the number of children of a given age (in days) represents \\(n = 1 / d\\) percents of the total number of children in the 0-\\(t_3\\) day-old cohort.\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a vaccination with two doses at \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) and let’s call \\(c_1\\) the vaccine coverage of the first dose and \\(c_2\\) the vaccine coverage of the second dose (i.e. given the first dose). Let’s call \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) the vaccine efficiencies of the first and second doses respectively.\nThe percentage of the cohort with one dose thus reads:\n\\[\np_1 = [(t_2 - t_1) \\times c_1 + (t_3 - t_2) \\times c_1 \\times (1 - c_2)] \\times n\n\\]\nAnd the percentage of the cohort with two doses reads:\n\\[\np_2 = (t_3 - t_2) \\times c_1 \\times c_2 \\times n\n\\]\nThe cohort level of sero-protection then reads:\n\\[\ns = p_1 \\times e_1 + p_2 \\times e_2\n\\]\n\n\n\nSometimes the vaccine coverage of the second dose is expressed as \\(c_2'\\) with the total number of children expected to received the 2 doses of vaccine in the denominator instead of number of children having already received a first dose as done for \\(c_2\\), meaning:\n\\[\nc_2' = c_1 \\times c_2\n\\]\nThen the above equations have to be updated with the percentage of the cohort with one dose now reading:\n\\[\np_1 = [(t_2 - t_1) \\times c_1 + (t_3 - t_2) \\times (c_1 - c_2')] \\times n\n\\]\nNote that we necessarily have the constraint \\(c_2' \\leq c_1\\) here. The percentage of the cohort with two doses now reads:\n\\[\np_2 = (t_3 - t_2) \\times c_2' \\times n\n\\]\nThe cohort level of sero-protection then reads:\n\\[\ns = p_1 \\times e_1 + p_2 \\times e_2\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis functions uses the above equations to compute the population level of sero-protection:\n\nprotection1 <- function(t1, t2, t3, c1, c2, e1, e2, conditional = TRUE) {\n  if (! conditional) {\n    if (c2 > c1) stop(\"c2 cannot be greater than c1.\")\n    c2 <- c2 / c1\n  }\n  n <- 1 / t3\n  one_dose <- ((t2 - t1) * c1 + (t3 - t2) * c1 * (1 - c2)) * n\n  two_doses <- (t3 - t2) * c1 * c2 * n\n  one_dose * e1 + two_doses * e2\n}\n\nLet’s see an example of this function use with the two expressions of the coverage of the second dose:\n\nprotection1(t1 = 9 * 30,  # timing of the first dose (in days)\n            t2 = 18 * 30, # timing of the second dose (in days)\n            t3 = 5 * 365, # duration of the cohort (in days)\n            c1 = .85,     # vaccine coverage first dose (btwn 93% and 96%)\n            c2 = .85,     # vaccine coverage second dose | first dose\n            e1 = .85,     # vaccine efficiency first dose\n            e2 = .95      # vaccine efficiency second dose\n)\n\n[1] 0.6664815\n\n\nand:\n\nprotection1(t1 = 9 * 30,  # timing of the first dose (in days)\n            t2 = 18 * 30, # timing of the second dose (in days)\n            t3 = 5 * 365, # duration of the cohort (in days)\n            c1 = .85,     # vaccine coverage first dose (btwn 93% and 96%)\n            c2 = .85,     # vaccine coverage second dose | first dose\n            e1 = .85,     # vaccine efficiency first dose\n            e2 = .95,     # vaccine efficiency second dose\n            conditional = FALSE\n)\n\n[1] 0.6754589"
